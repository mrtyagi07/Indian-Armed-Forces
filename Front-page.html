                  The Indian subcontinent had witnessed the cohesive
                  concentration of many Empires in the quest for control of
                  military power, and governance of the State. As time rolled
                  by, societal norms found an ethos in the workplace, the system
                  of rights and privileges, and service under the flag.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Army is divided into six operational commands (field
                  armies) and one training command, each under the command of a
                  Lieutenant General, who has an equal status to the Vice-Chief
                  of Army Staff (VCOAS), working under the control of Army HQ in
                  New Delhi.

                  Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our first Prime Minister, had rightly
                  said,‚Äù To be secure on Land, we must be Supreme at Sea‚Äù. This
                  famous quote always remind us that we are primarily a Maritime
                  Nation.

                <p>
                  The foundation of the modern Indian Navy was laid in the
                  seventeenth century when the East India Company had
                  established a maritime force, thereby graduating in time to
                  the establishment of the Royal Indian Navy in 1934. The
                  Headquarters of the Indian Navy is located in New Delhi, and
                  is under the command of the Chief of the naval staff.
